# Order-of-Growth-Visualization-for-Sorting-Algorithms
This project provides a comprehensive visualization of the time complexity and order of growth for various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort. By generating and analyzing both random and sorted datasets, this project aims to illustrate the efficiency of each algorithm under different conditions.
